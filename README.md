# Turtle Walkers - FTC Team Website

A small static website for the Turtle Walkers FTC team. It includes sections for team details, awards, outreach, YouTube videos, and a contact form.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main site
- `assets/styles.css` — styles
- `assets/script.js` — small JS for the contact form and date

How to view locally:

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file).

Or serve it with a simple local server (recommended for iframe/YouTube embedding):

```powershell
# from the project root (c:\GitHub\fts-turtlewalker)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Quick notes and next steps:
- Replace placeholder team details, email, and video IDs with real content.
- Optional: add images in `assets/` and tweak `styles.css`.
- If you want a contact backend (server-side email), I can add a minimal API and instructions.
